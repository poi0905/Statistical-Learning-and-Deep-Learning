# Statistical-Learning-and-Deep-Learning
Homework Repo of Statistical Learning and Deep Learning

The course encompassed topics such as regularized regression, classification, bootstrapping, and recently deep learning. The assignment in class required tools such as sklearn, torch, and torchvision packages. For our final project, we capitalized on the IMDb Dataset from Kaggle. Here, we leveraged embedding learning techniques to quantify actor traits and create groups based on similarity. Additionally, we utilized RMSE to predict movie ratings, achieving an error margin of approximately +/- 1.
